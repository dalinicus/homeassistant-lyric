This is a custom component for [Home Assistant](http://home-assistant.io) that overrides the [core lyric integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/lyric/).  Adds room sensor support not currently included in homeassistant-core.  This repository will be deprecated when/if this additional functionality is merged into homeassistant-core.
